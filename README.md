# ðŸ§  Business Optimization using Linear Programming (LP) | CodTech Internship

This repository contains **Task 4** of the CodTech Virtual Internship for Data Science. The task focuses on solving a **real-world business optimization problem** using **Linear Programming (LP)** techniques implemented in Python via the `PuLP` library. The objective is to maximize profit for an online retailer operating under limited warehouse space and product demand constraints.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Problem Statement

An online retail company wants to determine the optimal number of three types of productsâ€”**Laptops**, **Headphones**, and **Keyboards**â€”to store in a warehouse to **maximize total profit**. Each product occupies a different amount of space and has a different profit per unit. Additionally, there are constraints on the **maximum demand** for each item and the **total available warehouse space** (100 cubic meters).

The task is to model and solve this business scenario using **linear optimization**, find the best combination of products to store, and derive actionable business insights from the solution.

## ðŸ“Š Data & Assumptions

The problem assumes the following product-level data:

| Product     | Space Required (mÂ³) | Profit per Unit (â‚¹) | Maximum Demand |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Laptops     | 3                    | 4000                 | 20             |
| Headphones  | 1                    | 1500                 | 50             |
| Keyboards   | 2                    | 2000                 | 30             |

- Total warehouse space available: **100 mÂ³**
- Minimum 1 unit of each product must be stored to ensure product diversity

---

## ðŸ§® Methodology

The problem is formulated as a **Linear Programming model** with:
- **Objective Function**: Maximize total profit = `4000x + 1500y + 2000z`
- **Decision Variables**:
  - `x`: number of Laptops to store
  - `y`: number of Headphones to store
  - `z`: number of Keyboards to store
- **Constraints**:
  - `3x + 1y + 2z â‰¤ 100` (total warehouse space)
  - `x â‰¤ 20`, `y â‰¤ 50`, `z â‰¤ 30` (demand limits)
  - `x â‰¥ 1`, `y â‰¥ 1`, `z â‰¥ 1` (minimum presence)

The model is solved using the **`PuLP` library**, a powerful linear optimization tool in Python. The result provides the optimal values of `x`, `y`, and `z` that maximize the profit while satisfying all constraints.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

To improve interpretability and enhance presentation, the notebook includes:

1. **A product summary table** displaying all inputs in a structured format (via `pandas`)
2. **A bar chart** (via `matplotlib`) that visually shows how many units of each product should be stored to reach maximum profitability

These additions make the notebook more insightful and help communicate the results effectively.

## âœ… Results

The LP solver provided the following optimal solution:

- **Laptops to store**: 17 units  
- **Headphones to store**: 49 units  
- **Keyboards to store**: 1 unit  
- **Maximum Profit**: â‚¹1,41,500

This configuration utilizes the warehouse space efficiently and satisfies all constraints while yielding the **highest possible profit**.

---

## ðŸ§  Business Insights

- **Headphones** have the highest profit-to-space ratio, hence prioritized most.
- **Laptops**, while bulkier, contribute significantly due to their high profit.
- **Keyboards** are stored minimally to fulfill the "at least one" requirement.

This solution can help businesses plan their inventory and warehouse strategy more scientifically, making the best use of limited resources.
